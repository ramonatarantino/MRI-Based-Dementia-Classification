# MRI-Based-Dementia-Classification
## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of dementia using MRI brain images. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between different stages of dementia by analyzing MRI scans.

## Objective
To classify MRI brain images into various dementia stages.

To leverage machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of dementia diagnosis.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of MRI brain images categorized based on the dementia stage.
Images are divided into training and testing sets in a 4:1 ratio to ensure a robust learning process and reliable evaluation.

## Methodology
Data Preparation: MRI images are processed and standardized to ensure consistency in input data for the model.

Model Development: A machine learning model is designed to learn the distinguishing features of MRI scans associated with different dementia stages.

Training: The model is trained on the dataset, using the training set to learn the patterns associated with each dementia category.

Testing and Evaluation: The testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance, ensuring it can accurately classify unseen MRI images.

## Technologies
Machine Learning: Utilizes various algorithms and neural network architectures to learn from MRI data.

Image Processing: Techniques are applied to enhance and standardize MRI images for better model performance.
